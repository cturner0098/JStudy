# JStudy
A tool to help Japanese study.

The goal of this tool is to help people as lazy as I am study.
The program is small and can be hidden by hitting F10, so if you're not an idiot like
me, you will open the program and use it for whatever downtime you have on your computer (probably playing a shitty game).
Good luck studying.

I plan on adding support for bunpro once I stop being lazy and attempt to implement their API.
They choose to hold the reviews hostage as a 'private' api call not listed in their docs, but there is a nice
open source android app that uses them.
